# need to figure out the way to organize the actual icons of the files / folders on the desktop
# need to figure out / implement some error handling for the user input and just the flow of the program in general (how is an error handled / thrown?)
# essentailly, flesh out move, rename, validate_file_folder_name, make a function or functions for organizing files/folder icons...
# make program into an executable again too, that was pretty cool
# figure out how to allow users to cd into folders and cd out of them so they can organize further if they'd like...       
        
        
# basically all i want this program to do is to take all the files on a users desktop and help them organize it 
# so if it's already kinda organized they can just skip touching that folder and it's sub files / folders
# or they can go into that folder and move files around / organize it further - this needs to be implemented 
# it should be a serious of questions that ask the user what they want to do
# the user can choose etc...
